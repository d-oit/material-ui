# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to integrate PocketBase, a backend-in-a-box solution, with a Vite-based frontend application. The goal is to create a full-stack application that leverages PocketBase for database management and API services, while the frontend is built using Vite and React.

## What Problems It Solves
- Provides a seamless backend solution for small to medium-sized applications.
- Simplifies the development process by offering a ready-to-use backend.
- Allows developers to focus on frontend development without worrying about backend infrastructure.

## How It Should Work
- The frontend will communicate with the PocketBase backend using RESTful APIs.
- The application will be built using Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- React will be used for building the user interface.
- ESLint and Prettier will be configured for code quality and consistency.
